# Buggyfix 
<p>Buggyflix is the advanced version of Buggroll. Unlike <a href="https://github.com/jumlid/buggyroll">Buggyroll</a> were i used my google drive as the video hosting server here i used a third party  API to get the movies  </p>
<p> <b><u>How does it work? </u></b> <br>
Here i used two different Api to get the emerged links of the movies i used first api to get the imdb ID's of movies and used video src to play the video via the imdb id <br>
  <p> <b><u>Future planing </u></b> <br>
  i'm trying to store the all the searched results of every users on a data.json by this i can reduce the traffic of API request  and i'm also planing to add accounts and search history and stuff before that i'll focus on improving  UI/UX
</p>
<p>Update: Just realised insted of using id's  to differentiate every button( i mean the movie icon or class named box) with imdb id's i can use the custom data attribute ðŸ˜¿ This would have same me from lots of bugs -_- AH I'M DUMB  <p>
